Description
Image registration 3D 

Usage: 
In main3D.m contains registration examples of a sphere to a sun-like shape. The default number of multiresolution level and a maximum number of iteration is set as 3 and 1000. Users are free to change these values at line 7 and 10 in main.m. The default regularizes parameter, gamma and stopping tolerance (TOL) is set as 0.1 and 0.05 respectively. Users are free to change these values. 

main3DDiceSimilarity.m compute dice similarity between two given image with class label 0-11. 
The user can download such image from http://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/.
Download two discrete model of anatomic Brain model (raw byte file format) and save them in the 3D_multiresolution folder. Change the filenameI0 and filenameI0 in main_DiceSimilarity.m according to the downloaded files.
e.g. 

filenameI0='subject04_crisp_v.rawb';
filenameI0='subject05_crisp_v.rawb';

The readrawb.m function will read the data and output it as a 3-dimensional matrix which is suitable to use for further computation process. The x_size, y_size, and z_size in the readrawb function are set according to the volume information given in website mentioned above. The user will have to change these parameters accordingly if they would like to use it for reading other data. 
 
The dice similarity of each label will be printed in the text file with the filename dice_similarity.txt. 

The default regularizes parameter; gamma in this function is set as 1.54 such that the resulting transformation is diffeomorphic.   

Note that the image size is scaled into half in line 14 - 29 in main3DDiceSimilariy.m. The user can comment this line if they would like to run the program with the default size. However, it would request more memory space, and longer time for computing.  

Others options available included: 

1. PlotAll

Plotting image slices throughout the registration process. (yes=1 and No=0)
The default PlotAll is set as 1. 

2. SaveVideo  

Save the plotted frame as a video. (yes=1 and No=0)
The default SaveVideo is set as 0.
Note: Use can only save the video if the image slices are plotted (set PlotAll=1 )

3. SaveVtk

Save the moving image in each registration step in the vtk format, which user can later see them using visualization software such as Paraview. (yes=1 and No=0)
The default SaveVideo is set as 0.

4. compute_DiceSimilarity

Compute dice similarity between two given image with class label 0-11. 
The default compute_DiceSimilarity in main.m is set as 0 (No) while the default compute_DiceSimilarity in main_DiceSimilarity is set as 1 (Yes).

5. UseGaussian

Use a gaussian filter to smooth the transformation field. (yes=1 and No=0)
The default is set as 0.

This code is accelerated by using parallel computing and Mex file .

MATLAB Parallel Computing with "parfor" loop

Parallel computing refers to use multiple processors for computing.  This can be carried out in the loop where the execution is independent of each other.  To do this,  use "parfor" command instead of "for".  Note that nested "parfor" loop is not allowed, however, "for" loop can be used inside it.  We are using parallel computing in the following functions:

img2coef3D.
BsplineCompose3D
BsplineComposeImage3D

The code can be further accelerated by using  Mex-function, which can be generated using MATLAB code. User can create relavent Mex-functions for this 3D image registration program by runnning the make_mex_files3D.m script.
